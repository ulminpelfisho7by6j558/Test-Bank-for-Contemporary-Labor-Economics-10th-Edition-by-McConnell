  * Contemporary Labor Economics 10e presents labor economics as an applied field of micro and macro theory, no longer an area tangential to the core of analytical economics, but rather a critical component of that core. In the Tenth edition, the authors deliver new and updated discussions of public policy issues and coverage of the current economic crisis, while still integrating traditional topics such as labor law, structure of unions, and collective bargaining.
